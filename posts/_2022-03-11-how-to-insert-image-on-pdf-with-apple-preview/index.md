title: How to Paste an Image into a PDF with macOS Preview
---

The [Preview app](https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/preview/welcome/mac) on macOS is a handy way to edit and annotate PDFs.  Unfortunately, it's not easy or obvious how to insert an image into a PDF page.  I recently wanted to do this because I have a signature PNG image file I wanted to insert into a PDF.  The built-in signature functionality only lets you take a picture or draw your signature using the Trackpad.  I wanted neither and just wanted to copy/paste an image of my signature that I already had.

Here's how you can do it though.

1. Open the image file using Preview
2. Press Command+A, Command+C, then Command+V, then Command+C.  What this does is....
3. Open the targert PDF file using Preview
4. Scroll to the page you want to paste the image to and press Command+V.
