title: 10 Years
---

A little over 10 years ago, I wrote my first post here on this blog: [Why I Love Programming](/why-i-love-programming/).

I didn't expect to keep this blog going for 10 years but here I am.  It's been an enjoyable outlet for me to process thoughts, document things I want to reference, and a way to give back to the community.  Back in 2018, I wrote [10 Reasons to Blog](/ten-reasons-to-blog-pl/) with some more reasons why it's been a worthwhile endeavor.

Here's to the next 10 years!
