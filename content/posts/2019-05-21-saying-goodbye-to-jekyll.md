title: "Saying Goodbye to Jekyll"
---

I am saying goodbye to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) after using it for 4 years to build my blog here at geekytidbits.com.  I am transitioning to a static site generator I wrote called [xertz](https://github.com/bradymholt/xertz) and deployment handled by [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

When I [first started blogging back in December of 2010](https://www.geekytidbits.com/why-i-love-programming/) I used WordPress.  It worked great and I had a lot of fun customizing and setting everything up.  This was the first time I had worked with WordPress in earnest and I grew to respect it as a CMS platform.  Unwieldy at times yes, but powerful and simple to use.

After awhile I started wanting to tinker with things (of course!) and have more control over how my site was built and served.  This lead me to [transition to Jekyll in 2015](http://localhost:8080/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/).  I was working with Ruby pretty heavily at the time, Jekyll had a vibrant (and growing) community, and it was refreshing to have a site statically built and easily hostable as opposed to using a full LAMP stack with WordPress.  I had a lot of fun customizing settings and getting everything to my liking.

A few months ago I got the itch to look around for another static site generator because in the last few years some interesting projects have been gaining steam like [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).  I played around with a few and took note of similarities and differances from Jekyll.  One thing was sure: Jekyll seemed slow and a bit dated compared to some of these newer projects.

Ultimately, I decided to build my own because I thought it would be _fun_ to build, maintain and tweak it.  Also, the static site generators I tried were impressive but were either too feature rich for me or didn't quite suite my preferences.  No surprise there.

I plan to write more about xertz but in the meantime I need to finish up some polish, docs, and tests.
