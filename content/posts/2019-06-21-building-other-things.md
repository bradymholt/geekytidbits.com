title: "Building Other Things"
---

I really enjoy building software.  It's my profession but also my hobby.  That means I spent a lot of time doing it.  But every once in awhile I become a little less interested in building software and a little more interested in building something else.  Lately, that has meant building (or fixing) things around the house.  This past summer I decided our backyard needed something a little special for the kids.  Admittedly, some neighbors had recenly spruced up their own backyard with some kid attactions and I didn't want the kids _always_ wanting to be over there, you know.  Looking back fondly on a treehouse my Dad build for my sisters and me when we were young, I decided to build one for my backyard.

I find that building other things helps mix things up with my interests and prevents me from getting burned out from building software.

Here's how the treehouse turned out:
