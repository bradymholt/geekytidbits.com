title: About Me
---
![Brady Holt and Family](family.jpg#pull-right)My name is **Brady Holt**.  I'm a **software developer** by day and **geek** by night.  Writing software is my profession, hobby and passion.  During the day, I am a developer at [You Need A Budget][2] and at night I am usually spending time with my family or hacking on one of my many pet projects.  You might catch me playing with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Ruby, Node.js, Linux, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Docker or the new shiny tool that just popped up.  I am an **open source developer** and have several active [projects][3].

# Some History
Back in 1993 when I was 13 years old, I messed up my Mom's [8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) computer by accident to the point it would not boot.  She used the computer for her home based transcription business so I knew I was in serious trouble.  I tinkered with BIOS settings, skimmed the MS-DOS 3.2 book on her desk, and called every technical support 1-800 # I could find.  Eventually I fixed it and after the crisis was over, I realized I actually enjoyed tinkering with the computer.  Over the next year, I sold stuff and saved money until I was able to afford my own 386 machine to play with.  I was addicted to [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) and ran a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_blank">BBS </a>called "The Hard Drive".  A friend from church began teaching me how to program with [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and I was hooked!  I studied <a href="http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Departments/IROM/Degree-Programs/BBA/MIS" target="_blank">Management Information Systems</a> at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Austin</a> and began a career in software development.
